WARNING: This page under active development...

You can group test results by features and stories (BDD-like)

In order to group your tests by [features](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-core/wiki/Glossary#feature) and [stories](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-core/wiki/Glossary#user-story) in Java,\
 simply annotate the test suite or test case with **@Features** or **@Stories** annotations. Each of these annotations can take either a single string or a string array, because one test case can relate to seve\
ral [features](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-core/wiki/Glossary#feature) or [stories](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-core/wiki/Glossary#user-story):
```java
@Test
@Features("My Feature")
@Stories({"Story1", "Story2"})
public void myTest() {
    ...
}
```
